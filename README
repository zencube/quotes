# Quotes
## A quote http service powering [quotes.zencu.be](http://quotes.zencu.be)

This is a really simple HTTP-Service for getting text quotes.
It comes preloaded with 20 zen proverbs and inspirational quotes.

## Running the service
If you are on a linux x64 host, just run:

```shell
  $ ./quotes
```
which will start the server on port 8080. For a different port (or a specific address) run it with `--addr`:

```shell
  $ ./quotes --addr "127.0.0.1:9000"
```
would start the server listening only on localhost and port 9000.

## Building from source
With Go 1.1+ available run:

```shell
  $ go build -o quotes main.go
```
